# Day 35 - Milestone: Projects 4-6

- Challenge

    Before we proceed onto more complex projects, it’s important you have lots of time to stop and use what you already have. So, today you have a new project to make entirely by yourself, with no help from me other than some hints below. Are you ready?

    Your goal is to build an “edutainment” app for kids to help them practice multiplication tables – “what is 7 x 8?” and so on. Edutainment apps are educational at their code, but ideally have enough playfulness about them to make kids want to play.

    Breaking it down:

    - The player needs to select which multiplication tables they want to practice. This could be pressing buttons, or it could be an “Up to…” stepper, going from 1 to 12.
    - The player should be able to select how many questions they want to be asked: 5, 10, 20, or “All”.
    - You should randomly generate as many questions as they asked for, within the difficulty range they asked for. For the “all” case you should generate all possible combinations.

    If you want to go fully down the “education” route then this is going to be some steppers, a text field and a couple of buttons. I would suggest that’s a good place to start, just to make sure you have the basics covered.
